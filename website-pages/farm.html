        <h3>Basic Overview</h3>
        <p>Here is a simple overview of the journey coffee takes at the farm</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Planting and Cultivation</u></strong><br> 
                Coffee cultivation starts with growing coffee plants from seeds in nurseries.
                 Once these seedlings are robust enough, they are transplanted to the main coffee fields. Essential factors for successful cultivation
                  include maintaining the right soil conditions, managing water resources for consistent moisture,
                   and providing appropriate shade to mimic the coffee plant's natural habitat.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Harvesting</u></strong><br>
                Harvesting coffee cherries is a precise task.
                 Skilled labourers, often guided by experience and visual cues, select only the ripe cherries.
                  This can be done either by handpicking or mechanised harvesting.
                   The objective is to ensure that only the fully mature cherries are collected, as they contribute to the coffee's best flavour and quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Processing</u></strong><br> 
                Processing coffee cherries involves removing their outer layers to access the precious coffee beans inside.
                 Two primary methods are used: the "dry" or "natural" method and the "wet" or "washed" method.
                  Each method influences the coffee's flavour profile differently.
                   Dry processing involves sun-drying the cherries before extraction, resulting in bold, fruity notes.
                    Wet processing utilises fermentation and washing, leading to cleaner, brighter flavours.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Drying</u></strong><br>
                In the wet processing method, where cherries are fermented and washed,
                 the beans must be dried to achieve the proper moisture content.
                  Drying is a crucial step to prevent mould or spoilage.
                   Beans are typically laid out on drying patios or raised beds under the sun.
                    Proper drying ensures the beans reach the ideal moisture level of around 10-12%.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Milling and Sorting</u></strong><br> 
                Dried coffee beans undergo milling to remove any remaining layers, including the husk and parchment.
                 This process reveals the green coffee beans. The beans are then sorted to remove any defective or damaged ones.
                  Sorting is essential for maintaining quality, as only beans with consistent attributes proceed to the next stages of processing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Grading</u></strong><br> 
                Coffee beans are graded based on factors like size, quality, and density.
                 Grading serves as a critical step in determining the beans' value in the market.
                  Specialty coffee grading is especially meticulous, considering attributes beyond size, such as flavour, aroma, and overall quality.
                   Grading helps categorise beans, ensuring that coffee roasters and consumers can identify the precise characteristics they desire in their coffee.

                Planting and Cultivation
            </h3>
            <p class="section-text">
                The journey of coffee begins with meticulous planting and cultivation practices that set the foundation for the entire process.
                 Coffee plants belong to the Coffea genus, and the most well-known species are Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora).
                  These plants thrive in specific climatic conditions and altitudes, influencing the flavor profiles they produce.
                Planting coffee seeds involves creating nurseries where seeds are germinated in carefully controlled environments.
                 Once they grow into seedlings with a few pairs of leaves, they are transplanted to the main plantation.
                  Selecting the right location for the plantation is crucial, as the microclimate greatly impacts the quality of the beans.
                   For instance, high-altitude regions like the Colombian Andes or Ethiopian highlands are known for producing premium Arabica beans due
                    to the cooler temperatures and ideal soil conditions.
                Shade management is another essential aspect. Many coffee farms implement agroforestry practices, where coffee plants are cultivated alongside shade-providing trees.
                 This mimics the plant’s natural habitat and helps regulate temperature and sunlight.
                Farmers employ careful pruning techniques to encourage lateral branching, which helps increase fruit production and ease of harvest.
                 Proper soil management, including fertilization and composting, is crucial to ensure nutrient-rich environments for healthy plant growth.
                  Farms like Hacienda La Esmeralda in Panama are renowned for their meticulous attention to detail,
                   utilizing innovative cultivation practices to consistently produce award-winning Geisha coffee beans.
            </p>
            <p class ="section-summary">
                In summary, the planting and cultivation phase involves strategic selection of plant species, nursery management,
                 shade regulation, and soil care. It’s the initial step that determines the potential quality of the coffee beans,
                  and farms like Finca Rosa Blanca and Hacienda La Esmeralda serve as prime examples of the successful implementation of these practices.

                Harvesting
            </h3>
            <p class="section-text">
                The process of harvesting coffee cherries is a delicate and skillful task that greatly influences the quality of the beans.
                 Coffee cherries don’t ripen simultaneously, which requires selective picking to ensure only ripe cherries are collected.
                  This can be done manually or through mechanical means, but manual picking remains a common choice to maintain quality.
                In regions like Ethiopia’s Sidamo, smallholder farmers often handpick coffee cherries due to the varied ripening times.
                 They visually assess the colour and firmness of the cherries to determine ripeness. Similarly, in Brazil’s coffee-growing regions,
                  skilled labourers carefully handpick cherries, ensuring only the fully mature, red cherries are harvested.
                Selective picking involves multiple passes through the coffee trees over several weeks, as ripe cherries appear over time.
                 On the other hand, mechanical harvesting involves shaking the trees to dislodge cherries, which are then collected using machines.
                  This method is commonly used in larger plantations like those in Vietnam, where manual labour might be less feasible.
                Harvested cherries must be processed quickly to prevent spoilage. They are sorted to remove any under ripe or overripe cherries, debris, and leaves.
                 The chosen method—manual or mechanical—varies based on the farm’s resources and desired quality.
                  The balance between speed and precision is critical to maintain the cherries’ integrity.
            </p>
            <p class="section-summary">
                Overall, the harvesting process demands a deep understanding of coffee plants’ growth patterns and careful judgement to ensure
                 that only the highest-quality cherries make their way to subsequent processing stages.
                  Examples from Ethiopia and Brazil illustrate the diverse approaches to harvesting that contribute to the nuanced world of coffee production.

                Processing
            </h3>
            <p class="section-text">
                Once coffee cherries are harvested, they undergo specific processing methods that profoundly influence the flavour and characteristics of the final coffee beans.
                 Let’s explore three primary methods in detail: the wet process, natural process, and honey process.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong><u>Wet Process (Washed)</u></strong><br>
                In the wet process, ripe cherries are meticulously sorted to separate underripe and overripe ones.
                 The depulping stage removes the outer skin and fruit pulp, leaving the coffee beans covered in a layer of mucilage.
                  To ferment this mucilage, beans are placed in tanks with water, naturally breaking down the sugars and imparting distinct flavors.
                   The fermentation time varies based on factors like temperature and altitude.
                After fermentation, the beans undergo thorough washing to remove the mucilage.
                 This results in cleaner beans that are less likely to have fruity or fermented flavours.
                  Once washed, the beans are carefully dried to an optimal moisture content.
                   The wet process often produces coffees with a bright acidity, floral and tea-like notes, and a clean finish.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong><u>Natural Process (Dry)</u></strong><br> 
                The natural process involves a more hands-off approach.
                 Instead of depulping, the whole cherries are spread out under the sun to dry.
                  As they dry, the cherries undergo fermentation due to the sugars and mucilage remaining on the beans.
                   This extended contact between bean and fruit creates a unique flavour profile.
                    However, the process requires vigilant monitoring to prevent over fermentation or mold growth.
                Once the cherries are sufficiently dried and shrunken, mechanical hulling removes the outer layers, revealing the green coffee beans.
                 Natural processing often yields coffee with a heavy body, intense fruity flavors, and a pronounced sweetness.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong><u>Honey Process (Pulped Natural)</u></strong><br>
                The honey process is a nuanced technique that sits between the wet and natural methods.
                 After depulping, some or all of the mucilage is intentionally left clinging to the beans before they are dried.
                  The amount of mucilage left on the beans can be categorized as white, yellow, red, or black honey, each indicating a different degree of mucilage retention.
                During drying, the beans are regularly turned to ensure even drying and fermentation.
                 The retained sugars from the mucilage imbue the beans with unique flavors.
                  The honey process offers a wide spectrum of cup profiles, from the cleaner notes of white honey to the fruit-forward complexity of red and black honey.
            </p>     
            <p class ="section-summary">
                These processing methods contribute immensely to the final coffee flavour and character, making each cup a reflection of the choices made during these crucial stages. Regions like Ethiopia and Costa Rica are known for employing these methods to create a diverse array of flavor experiences for coffee enthusiasts.

            </h3>
            <p class="section-text">
                After the processing stage, coffee beans need to be properly dried to reach the ideal moisture content for storage and further processing.
                 Drying is a critical step that directly affects the quality and longevity of the beans.
                  There are various methods employed for drying, each with its own impact on flavour and characteristics.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong><u>Sun Drying</u></strong><br>
                Sun drying is the most traditional method of drying coffee beans.
                 In this approach, freshly processed beans are spread out on patios, raised beds, or even on the ground under the sun.
                  Regular turning of the beans ensures uniform drying. Sun drying is often used for natural-processed beans, where the cherries are dried whole.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong><u>Mechanical Drying</u></strong><br>
                In regions with unpredictable weather or limited space, mechanical drying is employed.
                 Hot air dryers or mechanical drum dryers are used to control the drying process.
                  This method requires close monitoring to prevent over-drying, which can negatively impact the beans’ flavour and quality.
            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong><u>Raised Beds</u></strong><br>
                Many specialty coffee producers prefer raised bed drying for its controlled environment.
                 Beans are spread in thin layers on elevated platforms that allow air circulation, ensuring even drying.
                  This method helps maintain the beans’ integrity and prevent the growth of mould or fungi.

            </p>

                <strong><u>African Beds</u></strong><br>
                African beds, also known as “African drying beds” or “African raised beds,” are common in regions with consistent sunlight.
                 These long, raised platforms are covered with a mesh to prevent direct contact between beans and the ground.
                  The beans are spread thinly to encourage efficient drying.

            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                <strong><u>Shade Drying</u></strong><br>
                Some regions opt for shade drying to slow down the drying process and preserve the beans’ delicate flavours.
                 In shade drying, the beans are protected from direct sunlight to prevent rapid moisture loss.
                  This method is often used for beans with complex and nuanced flavour profiles.

            </p>
            <p class="section-text">
                Drying times can vary depending on weather conditions and the specific method employed.
                 Properly dried beans should have a moisture content of around 10-12%.
                  Overdrying can lead to brittle beans, while underdrying can result in beans prone to mould and deterioration.
                Examples of these drying methods can be found around the world.
                 For instance, in Ethiopia’s Yirgacheffe region, sun drying is commonly practised on African drying beds.
                  In countries like Colombia, specialty producers utilise raised beds to carefully control the drying process and preserve the beans’ intrinsic qualities.

            </p>
            <p class="section-summary">
                In summary, drying is a pivotal step that requires attention and expertise to ensure the beans’ optimal moisture content and quality.

                <strong><u>Labelling and Transparency</u></strong><br>
                Beans that meet the criteria for specialty grade are often labelled as such.
                 This label signifies that the coffee has undergone a thorough evaluation and has passed the quality standards set by the Specialty Coffee Association.
                  Transparency about the coffee’s journey, from farm to cup, is also a hallmark of specialty coffee grading.

                Specialty coffee grading promotes a culture of continuous improvement.
                 Feedback from cupping sessions informs producers about their coffee’s strengths and areas for enhancement.
                  This process encourages growers to refine their practices and consistently strive for excellence.
