        <h3>Basic Overview</h3>
        <p>Here is a simple overview of the journey coffee takes at the farm</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Planting and Cultivation:</u></strong> Coffee cultivation starts with growing coffee plants from seeds in nurseries.
                 Once these seedlings are robust enough, they are transplanted to the main coffee fields. Essential factors for successful cultivation
                  include maintaining the right soil conditions, managing water resources for consistent moisture,
                   and providing appropriate shade to mimic the coffee plant's natural habitat.

                <strong><u>Harvesting:</u></strong> Harvesting coffee cherries is a precise task.
                 Skilled labourers, often guided by experience and visual cues, select only the ripe cherries.
                  This can be done either by handpicking or mechanised harvesting.
                   The objective is to ensure that only the fully mature cherries are collected, as they contribute to the coffee's best flavour and quality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Processing:</u></strong> Processing coffee cherries involves removing their outer layers to access the precious coffee beans inside.
                 Two primary methods are used: the "dry" or "natural" method and the "wet" or "washed" method.
                  Each method influences the coffee's flavour profile differently.
                   Dry processing involves sun-drying the cherries before extraction, resulting in bold, fruity notes.
                    Wet processing utilises fermentation and washing, leading to cleaner, brighter flavours.

            <li>
                <strong><u>Drying:</u></strong>  In the wet processing method, where cherries are fermented and washed,
                 the beans must be dried to achieve the proper moisture content.
                  Drying is a crucial step to prevent mould or spoilage.
                   Beans are typically laid out on drying patios or raised beds under the sun.
                    Proper drying ensures the beans reach the ideal moisture level of around 10-12%.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Milling and Sorting:</u></strong> Dried coffee beans undergo milling to remove any remaining layers, including the husk and parchment.
                 This process reveals the green coffee beans. The beans are then sorted to remove any defective or damaged ones.
                  Sorting is essential for maintaining quality, as only beans with consistent attributes proceed to the next stages of processing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Grading:</u></strong> Coffee beans are graded based on factors like size, quality, and density.
                 Grading serves as a critical step in determining the beans' value in the market.
                  Specialty coffee grading is especially meticulous, considering attributes beyond size, such as flavour, aroma, and overall quality.
                   Grading helps categorise beans, ensuring that coffee roasters and consumers can identify the precise characteristics they desire in their coffee.
