        <h3>Basic Overview</h3>
        <p>Here is a simple overview of the stages involved at the farm</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Planting and Cultivation: Coffee plants are grown from seeds in nurseries,
                 and once they’re strong enough, they’re transplanted to the main field.
                  They require careful nurturing, including proper soil, water, and shade management.
            </li>
            <li>
                Harvesting: Ripe coffee cherries are handpicked or mechanically harvested.
                 This step requires skilled labour to ensure only the ripe cherries are selected.
            </li>
            <li>
                Processing: The cherries’ outer layers are removed to extract the coffee beans.
                 There are two main processing methods: the “dry” method, where cherries are sun-dried before extraction,
                  and the “wet” method, which involves fermentation and washing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drying: If the wet processing method is used, the beans need to be dried to the right moisture content before they can be stored.
            </li>
            <li>
                Milling and Sorting: The dried beans go through milling machines to remove any remaining layers, and they are sorted to remove defective or damaged beans.
            </li>
            <li>
                Grading: Beans are sorted based on their size, quality, and density. This grading helps determine their value in the market.
            </li>
        </ul>
