        <h3>Basic Overview</h3>
        <p>Here is a simple overview of the journey coffee takes at a Roastery</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Sourcing</u></strong>  
                Specialty coffee roasters are dedicated to sourcing exceptional coffee beans.
                 They often establish direct relationships with coffee producers or cooperatives in regions celebrated for their coffee quality.
                  Meticulous selection involves considering factors like altitude, climate, and varietals, aiming to procure beans with distinctive flavour profiles.

                <strong><u>Green Bean Analysis</u></strong> Upon arrival, green coffee beans undergo an in-depth analysis.
                 Each bean is examined for specific attributes such as size, density, and moisture content.
                  Quality graders meticulously inspect beans, removing any that don't meet the rigorous standards set by the roastery.
                   This process ensures that only the highest-quality beans proceed to roasting.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Roasting</u></strong> Specialty coffee roasters employ cutting-edge roasting equipment to achieve precise control over temperature and timing.
                 The goal is to unlock the unique flavours hidden within each coffee origin.
                  Roasting profiles are tailored to bring out the desired characteristics, from bright acidity to complex aroma notes.
            <li>
                <strong><u>Cupping</u></strong>  After roasting, coffee enters a critical cupping phase.
                 Expert tasters, trained in sensory evaluation, meticulously evaluate the coffee's flavour, aroma, acidity, body, and aftertaste.
                  This rigorous assessment ensures that the coffee aligns with the roastery's flavour standards and provides an opportunity for fine-tuning roast profiles.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Packaging and Presentation</u></strong> Specialty coffee is meticulously packaged to reflect its quality and origins.
                 Labels often provide detailed information about the coffee's origin, flavour notes, and recommended brewing methods.
                  Presentation is a testament to the roastery's commitment to transparency and the coffee's journey from farm to cup.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><u>Education and Engagement</u></strong>  Many specialty coffee roasteries prioritise customer education.
                 They engage with coffee enthusiasts, sharing insights about coffee origins, processing, and brewing techniques.
                  This educational approach fosters a deeper appreciation for the craft and the unique qualities of each coffee bean.
