                Sourcing
            </h3>
            <p class="section-text">
                Specialty coffee roasteries take sourcing to an art form. They recognize that the foundation of exceptional coffee lies in the beans themselves.
                 To this end, they establish direct relationships with coffee producers or cooperatives in regions renowned for their coffee quality.
                 The sourcing process involves a meticulous selection of coffee beans, guided by multiple factors.
                  One of the most critical considerations is the altitude at which the coffee is grown.
                   High-altitude coffee often matures more slowly, resulting in beans with more concentrated flavours and complexity.
                Additionally, the climate and microclimate of the coffee farm play a vital role.
                 These conditions influence the beans' growth, flavour profile, and overall quality.

                Green Bean Analysis
            </h3>
            <p class="section-text">
                Green bean analysis is the critical first step in the journey of a coffee bean at a specialty coffee roastery.
                 Upon arrival, the green coffee beans undergo thorough scrutiny, a process that sets the stage for the coffee's ultimate flavour.
                One of the most critical aspects evaluated is the physical condition of the beans.
                 Specialty coffee beans are expected to be of exceptional quality, free from defects, and exhibiting specific characteristics.
                  Size, density, and moisture content are among the attributes carefully assessed.
                Size matters in the world of specialty coffee. While smaller beans aren't necessarily of lower quality,
                 larger beans often exhibit a more pronounced flavour profile.
                  Expert graders use screens to sort beans into different size categories, ensuring consistency and quality in each batch.
                Density is another crucial factor. Denser beans tend to roast more evenly, resulting in a balanced flavour profile.
                 In contrast, less dense beans may require adjusted roasting profiles to achieve the desired taste.
                Maintaining the appropriate moisture content is essential.
                 Beans with the correct moisture content (typically around 10-12%) roast more consistently and develop the desired flavours.
                  Beans with excessively high moisture content can be prone to mould and spoilage.
                Defects, if present, are meticulously identified and addressed.
                 Defects can take various forms, from insect damage to irregular shapes or discolorations.
                  High-quality specialty coffee beans should be free from these imperfections.
                Green bean analysis represents the roastery's commitment to quality.
                 It ensures that only the finest beans proceed to the roasting stage, where their full potential can be unlocked.

                The journey of a coffee bean during roasting is a dance of chemistry and artistry.
                 As the beans heat up, they undergo complex chemical reactions.
                  Sugars caramelise, acids break down, and Maillard reactions occur, all contributing to the flavour transformation.
                The timing of the roast is critical. Roasters carefully monitor the temperature of the beans and the duration of the roast to achieve specific flavour profiles.
                 For instance, a light roast may preserve the delicate floral and fruity notes of a coffee, while a dark roast might develop rich chocolate and caramel flavours.
                At the heart of specialty coffee is the commitment to showcasing the unique attributes of each coffee origin.
                 Roasters create roast profiles that accentuate the distinct flavour notes of the beans,
                  allowing consumers to explore the nuances of different regions and processing methods.
                Roasters often employ sample roasting, a small-scale roast of a coffee sample, to fine-tune the roast profile before proceeding with a larger batch.
                 This ensures that the coffee reaches its full potential without any undesirable characteristics.
                Ultimately, specialty coffee roasting is a balance between science and art.

                         They identify and describe the coffee's flavour notes, which can range from fruity and floral to nutty, chocolaty, or spicy.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><u>Acidity</u></strong><br>
                        Acidity refers to the bright, lively quality in coffee, not to be confused with bitterness.
                         Cuppers assess the coffee's acidity, describing its intensity and specific characteristics, such as citrus-like or malic acidity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><u>Body</u></strong><br>
                        Body pertains to the weight and texture of the coffee in the mouth.
                         Cuppers evaluate whether the coffee feels light, medium, or full-bodied and describe its viscosity.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong><u>Aftertaste</u></strong><br>
                        The final impression a coffee leaves is evaluated in the aftertaste.
                         Cuppers note the lingering flavours and the overall finish of the coffee.
                    </li>
                    <li>
